# Binary Decoder In Python
This is a binary decoder made in python.
## Running The Program  
To run the code you need to have python installed. You can install it [here](https://www.python.org).  
When you have python installed double click the run.bat file or open the file in terminal and type:
```
python decoder.py
```
If it does not work try:
```
python3 decoder.py
```
If it still does not work then you probably dont have python installed correctly.
## How To Use
When running the code on start it will ask you to enter a binary number
```
Enter A Binary Number: 
```
You Can Use The [Text To Binary Convereter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html) to convert any text to binary numbers.  
You need to enter the binary text one character by one so if i want to convert h i will type:
```
Enter A Binary Number: 01101000
```
When you press enter it will show the converted letter from binary:
```
Enter A Binary Number: 01101000
01101000 = 104 = h
```
You can type how many letters you want.  
To exit you just type "exit":
```
Enter A Binary Number: exit
```
It will show you all the converted characters joined together like so:
```
Enter A Binary Number: 01101000
01101000 = 104 = h
Enter A Binary Number: 01101001
01101000 = 105 = i
Enter A Binary Number: exit
hi
```
